<h2>Create your task sheet and give it a title</h2>
<p>Choose <span class="help-button help-button-menu">Tasks editor</span> from the top menu to start editing your new tasks sheet. Click <span class="help-button help-button-green">+ Add a title</span> to pull down a title edit box. To start entering the title click on a placeholder text in the center of the box. To delete an existing title click <span class="help-button help-button-red">Delete</span> button in the top right corner of the title edit box. Don't worry if you accidentally delete the title &mdash; its text will be restored if you click <span class="help-button help-button-green">+ Add a title</span> button again. And, by the way, the title is optional &mdash; don't make it up if you don't need it.</p>

<h2>Add a few tasks</h2>

<p>Click a big green <span class="help-button help-button-green">+ Add a new task</span> button &mdash; task editor will open (note that you can close it at any time abandoning any changes you've made by clicking <span class="help-button">Cancel</span> button in its top right corner). The editor consists of three blocks &mdash; two operands and an operation between them. Operand blocks are identical, they allow you either to select a number of objects to display (3x3 icons with dots, from one to nine) or to enter a number (bottom row). Operation block allows you to select either one of arithmetic operations or a lower-tnan/greater-than gizmo.</p>

<p>Once you've selected values in all three blocks, <span class="help-button">Save</span> button appears in the top right corner of the task editor &mdash; click it to save your changes. Now you can either <span class="help-button">Edit</span> or <span class="help-button help-button-red">Delete</span> the task by pressing a corresponding button in the top right corner of the task row (note that these buttons only appear when you hover the row with a mouse).</p>

<p>You can add as many tasks as you like to your sheet, but note that when you print it out, a standard A4 page will fit 5 tasks in portrait orientation and 10 in landscape.</p>

<h2>Print them out</h2>

<p>After you've added at least one task to your sheet <span class="help-button help-button-menu">Print out the sheet below</span> button appears in the top menu on the page &mdash; click it to invoke your browser's printer dialog. Please note that by changing page orientation you can control physical size of printed tasks and, as a result, how many of them fit on a single page. In portrait orientation tasks will be quite big and there will be 5 of them per A4 page &mdash; that suits smaller children. In landscape orientation tasks become smaller and 10 of them will fit on a page.</p>

<h2>Save or share a task sheet</h2>

<p>You may have noticed by this point that all the changes you apply to the sheet synchronously change a URL of the web page in an address bar of your browser. The reverse is also true &mdash; if you figure out the format (and it is not a rocket science) you will be able to change your task sheet by changing the URL of the page. Anyway, if you need to save a task sheet for later &mdash; just copy the URL of the page from your browser's address bar into clipboard and paste it into a text editor of your choice. If you want to share the sheet with someone &mdash; just email them that URL.</p>
