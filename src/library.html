<h2>Dear parent,</h2>
<p>Papa has created a few task sheets for his little one to crunch through and published them below. You may want to use them as is or as a starting point for your own set, but please don't assume this is a kind of a definitive course or an officially approved study programme &mdash; it isn't.</p>
